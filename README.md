# FCC-ML
Projects for Free Code Camp Certification

5 Project I made are:

1. Book Reccomentdation Generator using K-Nearest Neighbours 📖
  - Used a dataset from FCC that contained 1.1 million ratings (scale of 1-10) of 270,000 books by 90,000 users.
  - Clean data to only use relevant reveiws
  - Create a KNN model and also implemented a function that returns 5 recommendes books based of the book you input
  
2. Predict Health Care Costs using Linear Regression 🏥💸 
  - Used a dataset from FCC that contained over 1300 different patients insurance with 7 different demographics for each patient
  - Cleaned data and split into train and test data sets
  - Solved problem using NN and was able to improve network by anyalising loss
  - Was able to predict Health Care Costs Insurance Costs within $1904

3. Cat and Dog Classifier using Convelutional Neural Networ😺🐶
  - Used a dataset from FCC that contained over 4000 images of cats and dogs 
  - Cleaned and used Data Augmentation to transform dataset to over _______ images
  - Was able to create a model that could predict a cat/dog with a 68% accuracy
 
4. "Ham or Spam" Text Message Classifier using Sentimental Anyalsis 📩✅ 
  - Used a dataset from FCC with over 4000 label text messages
  - Tokenized and Padded training data
  - Created model that was able to classify messages with a 93% accuracy
 
5. Developed Rock Paper Scissors Algorithm 🪨📃✂️
  -Able to create algorthim based counting the frequnecy of patterns that 
  the opponent plays
